        <h1>Welcome to MakersValley!</h1>
             <p>In April 2016 in Brooklyn, I co-founded a fashion tech startup called MakersValley. MakersValley connects boutique owners and fashion designers with 150+ Italian apparel manufacturers with no minimums, no markups, and a dedicated account manager to guide you through the apparel manufacturing process. I work on MakersValley full-time in downtown St. Louis. I love working with our customers and helping them bring their designs to life!</p>
             <p>Below I'll tell you a little more about MakersValley so you can learn about my startup. If you've ever designed clothes or had an idea for the "perfect jacket" for example, MakersValley might be able to help you!</p>

         <h3>Our Mission</h3>
         <img src="images/gennaro_making_suit.png" alt="Italian artisan making a suit">
         <p>MakersValley connects and enables manufacturers and designers worldwide
anytime, anywhere. MakersValley is an online B2B service platform that
aims to democratize the manufacturing industry by making it more
transparent and accessible.</p>

<p>Our mission is breaking down all the barriers. Connecting local makers with designers
anytime and anywhere in the world. We enable and celebrate greatness and
we promote cross-cultural understanding!</p>

<p>We imagine a world where no matter what race, nationality and
geographical position, every person has the opportunity to connect with
great makers all around the world and expand their possibilities. We imagine
a world where small local Brazilian designers can easily get in touch with a
small Italian Manufacturer or artisan, allowing them to connect and enabling
greatness in one another and their cultural peculiarity. We imagine a world
where doing business between two rural villages in two different countries and continents is possible and easy.</p>

<h3>Be Inspired</h3>

<p><em>No sample? No pattern? No problem!</em> MakersValley aims to democratize the manufacturing industry by making it more accessible and transparent. One way we're doing that is by helping designers make their collection even if they don't have the technical know-how to create their own pattern or the time to go and find a sample garment to base their collection on. That’s why we’re launching our Be Inspired catalog, where you can be instantly inspired by hundreds of 100% Made in Italy white label samples, produced by our Italian manufacturers and artisans, customizable by you for your own brand label.  Jumpstart your collection with MakersValley today!</p>
